                <h3>by Eric Clapton®</h3>
                <p>Would you know my name?<br>
                    If I saw you in heaven<br>
                    Would it be the same?<br>
                    If I saw you in heaven</p>
                <p>I must be strong<br>
                    And carry on<br>
                    'Cause I know I don't belong<br>
                    Here in heaven</p>
                <p>Would you hold my hand?<br>
                    If I saw you in heaven<br>
                    Would you help me stand?<br>
                    If I saw you in heaven</p>
                <p>I'll find my way<br>
                    Through night and day<br>
                    'Cause I know I just can't stay<br>
                    Here in heaven</p>
                <p>Time can bring you down<br>
                    Time can bend your knees<br>
                    Time can break your heart<br>
                    Have you begging please<br>
                    Begging please</p>
                <p>Beyond the door<br>
                    There's peace, I'm sure<br>
                    And I know there'll be no more<br>
                    Tears in heaven</p>
                <p>Would you know my name?<br>
                    If I saw you in heaven<br>
                    Would you be the same?<br>
                    If I saw you in heaven</p>
                <p>I must be strong<br>
                    And carry on<br>
                    'Cause I know I don't belong<br>
                    Here in heaven</p>
